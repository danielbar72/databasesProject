Huntington's disease,HTT (IT15),"Huntington's disease is a progressive brain disorder that causes uncontrolled movements, emotional problems, and loss of thinking ability (cognition). Early signs and symptoms can include irritability, depression, small involuntary movements, poor coordination, and trouble learning new information or making decisions. Many people with Huntington's disease develop involuntary jerking or twitching movements known as chorea. As the disease progresses, these movements become more pronounced. Affected individuals may have trouble walking, speaking, and swallowing. People with this disorder also experience changes in personality and a decline in thinking and reasoning abilities. ","Although Huntington's disease cannot be cured, drugs like haloperidol, tetrabenazine, and amantadine are especially helpful for controlling the unusual movements caused by Huntington disease."
Familial hyperaldosteronism type I,CYP11B1,"Familial hyperaldosteronism is a group of inherited conditions in which the adrenal glands, which are small glands located on top of each kidney, produce too much of the hormone aldosterone. Excess aldosterone causes the kidneys to retain more salt than normal, which in turn increases the body's fluid levels and blood pressure. In familial hyperaldosteronism type I, hypertension generally appears in childhood to early adulthood and can range from mild to severe. ","Once the diagnosis is ascertained, small doses of glucocorticoids (dexamethasone at 0.125-0.250 mg/day or prednisone at 2.5 -5 mg/day) are sufficient to correct hypertension and reduce the production of aldosterone."
Familial hyperaldosteronism type III,KCNJ5,"Familial hyperaldosteronism is a group of inherited conditions in which the adrenal glands, which are small glands located on top of each kidney, produce too much of the hormone aldosterone. Excess aldosterone causes the kidneys to retain more salt than normal, which in turn increases the body's fluid levels and blood pressure. In most individuals with familial hyperaldosteronism type III, the adrenal glands are enlarged up to six times their normal size.",In most cases FH-III patients are resistant to pharmacological therapy and require bilateral adrenalectomy to control symptoms.
Marfan syndrome,FBN1,"Marfan syndrome is a disorder that affects the connective tissue. Because connective tissue is found throughout the body, Marfan syndrome can affect many systems, often causing abnormalities in the heart, blood vessels, eyes, bones, and joints. The two primary features of Marfan syndrome are vision problems caused by a dislocated lens (ectopia lentis) in one or both eyes and defects in the large blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body (the aorta).","While there is no cure for Marfan syndrome, treatment focuses on preventing the various complications of the disease. Depending on your signs and symptoms, procedures might include: aortic repair, scoliosis treatment, breastbone corrections, and eye surgeries."
Type 1 hemochromatosis ,HFE,"Hereditary hemochromatosis is a disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron from the diet. The excess iron is stored in the body's tissues and organs, particularly the skin, heart, liver, pancreas, and joints. Because humans cannot increase the excretion of iron, excess iron can overload and eventually damage tissues and organs. Type 1, the most common form of the disorder, begins in adulthood. Men with type 1 or type 4 hemochromatosis typically develop symptoms between the ages of 40 and 60, and women usually develop symptoms after menopause.","The most commonly used treatment for haemochromatosis is a procedure to remove some of your blood, known as a venesection or phlebotomy."
Type 2 hemochromatosis ,HJV,"Hereditary hemochromatosis is a disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron from the diet. The excess iron is stored in the body's tissues and organs, particularly the skin, heart, liver, pancreas, and joints. Because humans cannot increase the excretion of iron, excess iron can overload and eventually damage tissues and organs. Type 2 hemochromatosis is known as a juvenile-onset disorder because symptoms often begin in childhood. By age 20, iron accumulation causes decreased or absent secretion of sex hormones. If type 2 hemochromatosis is untreated, potentially fatal heart disease becomes evident by age 30.","The most commonly used treatment for haemochromatosis is a procedure to remove some of your blood, known as a venesection or phlebotomy."
Cystic fibrosis ,CFTR,"Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease characterized by the buildup of thick, sticky mucus that can damage many of the body's organs. The disorder's most common signs and symptoms include progressive damage to the respiratory system and chronic digestive system problems. The features of the disorder and their severity varies among affected individuals.","There is no cure for cystic fibrosis, but treatment can ease symptoms, reduce complications and improve quality of life. Medications include: antibiotics to treat and prevent lung infections, anti-inflammatory medications to lessen swelling in the airways in your lungs, mucus-thinning drugs to help cough up the mucus, oral pancreatic enzymes to help your digestive tract absorb nutrients, stool softeners to prevent constipation or bowel obstruction, and drugs that target gene mutations, including a new medication that combines three drugs to treat the most common genetic mutation causing CF."
Sickle cell anemia ,HBB,"Sickle cell disease is a group of disorders that affects hemoglobin, the molecule in red blood cells that delivers oxygen to cells throughout the body. People with this disease have atypical hemoglobin molecules called hemoglobin S, which can distort red blood cells into a sickle or crescent shape. Characteristic features of this disorder include a low number of red blood cells (anemia), repeated infections, and periodic episodes of pain. The severity of signs and symptoms varies from person to person.","A bone marrow transplant is currently the only cure for some patients who have sickle cell disease. After early diagnosis, your healthcare provider may recommend medicines or transfusions to manage complications, including chronic pain."
Phenylketonuria (PKU),PAH,"Phenylketonuria (commonly known as PKU) is an inherited disorder that increases the levels of a substance called phenylalanine in the blood. Phenylalanine is an amino acid that is obtained from eating certain foods (such as meat, eggs, nuts, and milk) and in some artificial sweeteners. If PKU is not treated, phenylalanine can build up to harmful levels in the body, causing intellectual disability and other serious health problems.","PKU can often be managed by following a diet that is low in phenylalanine. Since phenylalanine is found in all proteins, the PKU diet consists of avoiding meat, dairy, nuts, tofu, and other foods that are high in protein."
Rett syndrome,MECP2,"Rett syndrome is a rare genetic neurological and developmental disorder that affects the way the brain develops. This disorder causes a progressive loss of motor skills and language. Some children with Rett syndrome are affected more severely than others. Also, the age at which symptoms first appear varies from child to child. Rett syndrome primarily affects females.","Optimal treatment of Rett syndrome includes a multidisciplinary approach that addresses symptoms and signs. A program of occupational therapy, physical therapy, and communication therapy (with a speech and language therapist) should be provided to address self-help skills such as feeding and dressing, limited mobility, walking difficulty, and communication deficits. Medications may be needed to control seizures and behavior disturbances, for breathing dysfunction, or for motor difficulties."
Incontinentia pigmenti,IKBKG,"Incontinentia pigmenti is a rare X-linked dominant genetic condition characterised by skin, eye, teeth and central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities.",There is no specific treatment for incontinentia pigmenti. The main goal is to prevent secondary bacterial infection of skin lesions and to monitor closely the development of related problems. This should include regular dental care and close monitoring by an ophthalmologist for the first few years of life.
Color blindness,OPN1LW,"Color blindness occurs when you are unable to see colors in a normal way. It is also known as color deficiency. Color blindness often happens when someone cannot distinguish between certain colors. This usually happens between greens and reds, and occasionally blues.","There is no cure, but special glasses and contact lenses can help people see differences between colors."
Hemophilia A,F8,"Hemophilia A, also known as classical hemophilia, is a genetic bleeding disorder caused by insufficient levels of a blood protein called factor VIII. Factor VIII is a clotting factor. Clotting factors are specialized proteins that are essential for proper clotting, the process by which blood clumps together to plug the site of a wound to stop bleeding. Individuals with hemophilia A do not bleed faster or more profusely than healthy individuals, but because their blood clots poorly, they have difficulty stopping the flow of blood from a wound. ","The best way to treat hemophilia is to replace the missing blood clotting factor so that the blood can clot properly. This is typically done by injecting treatment products, called clotting factor concentrates, into a person's vein."
Tay-Sachs disease,HEXA,"Tay-Sachs disease is a rare genetic disorder passed from parents to child. It's caused by the absence of an enzyme that helps break down fatty substances. These fatty substances, called gangliosides, build up to toxic levels in the brain and spinal cord and affect the function of the nerve cells.",Presently there is no specific treatment for Tay-Sachs disease. Anticonvulsant medicine may initially control seizures. Other supportive treatment includes proper nutrition and hydration and techniques to keep the airway open. Children may eventually need a feeding tube.
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD),DMD,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic condition that gradually weakens muscles, impacting movement and daily activities. DMD is caused by a mutation in a specific gene that helps produce the protein dystrophin, which is important for muscle strength, support and repair. DMD mainly affects male children and occasionally affects female children. Duchenne muscular dystrophy has X-linked recessive inheritance, but about 30% of cases happen spontaneously without a family history of the condition.","Supportive therapies for DMD include corticosteroids(medicines that are beneficial for delaying muscle strength loss, improving lung function, delaying scoliosis, and slowing the progression of cardiomyopathy), medication to treat cardiomyopathy, physical therapy, surgery to help treat scoliosis and contractures, and exercise."
Neurofibromatosis type 1,NF1,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic condition that causes tumours to grow along your nerves. The tumours are usually non-cancerous (benign) but may cause a range of symptoms. In most cases, the skin is affected, causing symptoms such as café au lait spots, neurofibromas, clusters of freckles in unusual places, and problems with the bones, eyes and nervous system.","There is currently no cure for NF1. Treatment can involve surgery(to remove tumors and treat problems with bones), medicine (to control secondary conditions, such as high blood pressure), physiotherapy, psychological support, and pain management."
Neurofibromatosis type 2,NF2,Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of multiple tumors involving the central nervous system (CNS). Bilateral vestibular schwannomas are the hallmark feature of NF2 and present in approximately 90 to 95 percent of patients.,"There is currently no cure for NF2. Treatment involves regular monitoring and treating any problems as they occur. Surgery can be used to remove most tumours, although it carries a risk of causing problems, such as complete deafness or facial weakness."
Schwannomatosis,SMARCB1,"Schwannomatosis, a type of neurofibromatosis, is a rare genetic disorder that results in multiple tumors (called schwannomas) that grow on the coverings of peripheral nerves throughout the body and can cause debilitating pain and neurological dysfunction.","Stereotactic irradiation and surgeryare the main treatment options for schwannomatosis. However, there is evidence of effective targeted therapy with bevacizumab (inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor)."
Angelman syndrome,UBE3A,"Angelman syndrome causes delayed development, problems with speech and balance, mental disability, and, sometimes, seizures. Many people with Angelman syndrome smile and laugh often. They tend to be happy and easy to excite.","Treatment may include anticonvulsant medication for seizures, physical therapy to help with joint mobility and movement, speech therapy, occupational therapy, and behavior therapy."
Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease,PMP 22,"Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is an inherited neurological condition that causes problems with the muscles of your feet, legs, arms and hands. CMT disease is a progressive condition, which means it tends to get worse over time. It affects people in different ways, but usually CMT disease doesn’t cause severe disability or reduce life expectancy.","While there is no cure for CMT, proper foot care including custom-made shoes and leg braces can help to reduce discomfort and retain function. There are many other therapies that can help, such as physiotherapy, surgery to correct bone abnormalities, and occupational therapy."
